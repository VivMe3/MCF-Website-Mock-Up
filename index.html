            Our Sunday services aim to be an opportunity for Christians and non-Christians to see how God affects real, everyday life. What to expect when you first visit - Our band kicks the service off with a time to worship and prepare our hearts to learn, then we have a contemporary and relevant teaching, and we conclude with time for informal fun and fellowship. Come as you are. Dress is casual.

Groups get together each week to learn about the Bible and to have fun together. It’s a great way to meet new people while exploring your faith. There are four great reasons to join a Growth Group:

              God created man in His own image, and man, as he was originally created, was innocent before God. But man chose to sin by disobeying God and therefore was alienated from his Creator and came under divine condemnation. Thus all human beings are born with a corrupted nature and without spiritual life, and are totally incapable of pleasing God in and of themselves.

                God the Father, by His own choice and out of love for sinful men and women, sent Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. He is God in the flesh, both true God and true man.<br />

Jesus Christ lived a sinless life and voluntarily suffered and died as our substitute to pay the penalty for our sins, thus satisfying God’s justice and accomplishing salvation for all who trust in Him alone. He rose from the dead in the same body, though glorified, in which He lived and died. He bodily ascended into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God the Father, where He, the only mediator between God and man, makes intercession for His own. He will return to earth personally, visibly and bodily to judge all men and establish His Kingdom.
